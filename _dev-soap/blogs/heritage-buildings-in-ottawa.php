                        <p>Move over Parliament Hill, Ottawa has plenty of architecturally beautiful buildings that deserve our attention. At Solii, we are suckers for the luxurious cachet of heritage architecture and everything that comes with it. </p>

                        <p>Just as our custom doors and windows are made with time-honoured craftsmanship and technique, so were some of Ottawa’s most unique and commanding buildings. As a business in the nation’s capital, we always strive to maintain a sense of awe and deep respect for the history we’re surrounded with.</p>

                        <p>We thought we’d round up some of the city’s most architecturally beautiful buildings for your viewing pleasure and inspiration. Know that with us, no design is impossible - so who knows? Maybe some history will rub off on your very own home.</p>
