                        <p>Move over Parliament Hill, Ottawa has plenty of architecturally beautiful buildings that deserve our attention.</p>

                        <p>Although it’s the focal point of every entrance and exit we make in our home, front door maintenance is often overlooked.</p>

                        <p>As fanatics of beautiful doors and windows, we want to shine a spotlight on your trusty front door, because after all, it’s key (pun totally intended!) to creating the perfect first impression. </p>
                        <p>Not only is your front door a great way to invest in guaranteed curb appeal during resale, but it also sets the tone for what’s to come. How do you know it’s time for an upgrade, though? Here are 5 signs that you may want to invest in a new front door, and when that happens - <a href="https://solii.ca/contact">call us</a>! ;)</p>

                        <h3>1. You’re Feeling a Draft</h3>
                        <p>The most obvious sign your front door needs replacing; you can feel cold air coming into your home from around it. No need to suffer through Ottawa’s already frigid winters—start thinking about a new door as soon as you feel that unwelcome draft. </p>
